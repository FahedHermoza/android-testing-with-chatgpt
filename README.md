Welcome to Android Testing with ChatGPT! The goal of this repository is to implement the use of an AI tool like ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù in the testing process, adhering to the current standards used by an Android engineering team. With this proposal, we can achieve significantly shorter development times for "Test case generation", "Test data generation", and the "Creation of explanatory comments"

Here is a guide that will give you an introduction to the terminology used in this repository: A Brief Narrative, Repository Overview, Android Testing, Testing Approach, ChatGPT (Context, Custom Instructions, controversy), Generation of Similar Functions.

This contains all topics to help you find what you are looking for quickly. I hope I can help you.

## üè† Base Project
For the examples in the repository, we used the android-showcase project by Igor Wodja as a foundation. This project was chosen because it adheres to the best practices in the industry up to the present day. Although the application is small, it could be considered as an enterprise-type application due to the comprehensive architecture of its core.

## ü§ñüí¨ Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tool: ChatGPT
ChatGPT is a natural language processing artificial intelligence tool developed by OpenAI. While ChatGPT can offer valuable assistance, it‚Äôs crucial to emphasize that it should not be considered a replacement for thorough code reviews, rigorous testing, or professional advice when addressing critical tasks in software development. Software engineers should use ChatGPT as a complementary tool to enhance their productivity and problem-solving skills, especially in specific cases such as testing.

Taking advantage of its ability to generate coherent and relevant text, we will focus on three key applications of ChatGPT in software testing:

1. **Test Case Generation:** ChatGPT can assist in automatically generating test cases in natural language. Describing the expected behavior of a function or feature allows ChatGPT to generate detailed test cases.
2. **Test Data Generation:** ChatGPT can be used to generate realistic test data, valuable for evaluating software performance and scalability.
3. **Documentation, Comments, and Support:** ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for creating documentation, both for end-users and internal use. It facilitates explaining how to use various functions and provides answers to frequently asked questions.

While we can create basic templates using ChatGPT, **the output always must undergo a thorough review by a software engineer**. This is because the tool's effectiveness is approximately 60%, which means there will always be a margin of error that needs to be analyzed, taking into consideration the engineer's expertise.

## üß© Integration Test
Integration tests are responsible for verifying interactions and connection points among various components, modules, and services within an Android application.

### Guidelines
1. Keep tests small, individual, and focused.
2. Function names should use interpolated strings, respecting spaces, following the structure: Given - When - Then.
3. The function structure should follow the AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert).
4. The class name should use the Test suffix.
5. Tools used: JUnit and Mockito or JUnit and MockK.
6. Declare global variables using the @Mock annotation for Mockito or @MockK for MockK, with variable names suffixed with "mock."
7. Use runTest to carry out the execution of asynchronous processes.
8. If you need to generate data for tests, use the structure of Martin Fowler's Object Mother pattern.

### Parent Class
Our example implementation has a base class called BaseTest, from which all test classes will inherit, conforming to the structure built within this class.
```
@ExperimentalCoroutinesApi
abstract class BaseIntegrationTest {
    @get:Rule
    val testInstantTaskTaskExecutorRule = InstantTaskExecutorRule()

    @Before
    fun setup() {
        val testDispatcher = StandardTestDispatcher()
        Dispatchers.setMain(testDispatcher)
        MockKAnnotations.init(this)
    }

    @After
    fun tearDown() {
        Dispatchers.resetMain()
        unmockkAll()
    }

    abstract fun build()
}
```

## üöÄ Test Case Generation
To create similar functions from a sample base class, we will use the concept of Seed and Generator from the realm of pseudo-random numbers, explained in detail in the Guidelines.

We will base ourselves on 2 structures:
The first one, the structure using the ChatGPT context. ChatGPT is designed to maintain context within a conversation, allowing it to understand and respond to the current thread of conversation.

The second one, using custom instructions. Through this functionality, ChatGPT allows us to preload 2 prompts through 2 questions, which will be useful to load the seed and the generator. Here, we must take into account the limit of 1500 characters for each preloaded prompt.

### üõ†  Using the context
Seed
```
You should take this class as the base for future kotlin classes, keeping the structure:
[Example Base Class]

Base Class: The Kotlin test class [Name Example Base Class] extends [Name Parent Class].
[Parent Class]
```

Generator
```
Role: Behaving as an Android expert, we'll conduct unit testing for a Kotlin class.

Testing Framework: We will use the library [MockK or Mockito].

Testing Guidelines:
- Keep tests individual and focused.
- Using string interpolation, spaces, and descriptive names for test functions.
- Incorporating the parts "Given," "When," and "Then" in test function names.
- Follow the AAA pattern for test functions.
- Declare global variables using the @Mock annotation, with variable names suffixed by "mock."
- The test must use "runTest" as coroutine builder.

Kotlin Class to Test:
[Class or function to test]
```

### üõ† Using custom instructions

Seed: What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?
```
You should take this class as the base for future kotlin classes, keeping the structure:
[Example Base Class]
```

Generator: How would you like ChatGPT to respond?
```
Role: Behaving as an Android expert, we'll conduct unit testing for a Kotlin class.

Testing Framework: We will use the library [MockK or Mockito].

Base Class: The Kotlin test class extends [Name Parent Class].
[Parent Class]

Testing Guidelines:
- Keep tests individual and focused.
- Using string interpolation, spaces, and descriptive names for test functions.
- Incorporating the parts "Given," "When," and "Then" in test function names.
- Follow the AAA pattern for test functions.
- Declare global variables using the @Mock annotation, with variable names suffixed by "mock."
- The test must use "runTest" as coroutine builder.

## üöÄ Test Data Generation
Use the structure of the Object Mother pattern to generate test data. Add the suffix "Mother" to the class name, for example, CreateAdditionalCardMother. The term "Mother" comes from Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and symbolizes the birth or creation of objects. In the context of Martin Fowler's Object Mother pattern, these classes are used to centralize the creation of test objects and provide default values to simplify test data setup. It is advisable to use this class for objects that exceed 10 lines of code.

### üõ†Ô∏è Using the context
Seed
```
You should take this class as the base for future kotlin mother classes:
[Example Base Class]
```

Generator
```
Task: Can you give me a function that mocks the following class to test? 

Testing Language: Kotlin

Testing Guidelines:
- Use Martin Fowler's mother pattern object. 
- Provide default values that are neither null nor empty. 
- Don't generate comments on default values:

Class to convert:
[class or data class structure]

Consider the following related classes:
[Child class structures]
```
